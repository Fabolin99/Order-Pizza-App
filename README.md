# Overview

This program is intended to provide real-life scenarios where coding is required.
In other words, it provides the opportunity to simulate a pizza online order.
It provides also the opportunity to create a pizza, see the menu, calculate the 
final price, and leave a review.

This program is also a great opportunity to learn the basics of java. It provides
an easy and clear code to understand by experts or news in Java.
